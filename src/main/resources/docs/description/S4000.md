The `IntPtr` and `UIntPtr` types are used to access unmanaged memory, usually in order to use C or C++ libraries. If such a
pointer is not secured by making it `private`, `internal` or `readonly`, it can lead to a vulnerability allowing
access to arbitrary locations.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class MyClass
  {
    public IntPtr myPointer;  // Noncompliant
    protected UIntPtr myOtherPointer; // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>

## Compliant Solution

<pre>
using System;

namespace MyLibrary
{
  public class MyClass
  {
    private IntPtr myPointer;
    protected readonly UIntPtr myOtherPointer;
  }
}
</pre>
