## Why is this an issue?

Certain [bitwise operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/bitwise-and-shift-operators)
are not needed and should not be performed because their results are predictable.

Specifically, using `& -1` with any value always results in the original value.

That is because the binary representation of `-1` on a [integral numeric type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types) supporting
negative numbers, such as `int` or `long`, is based on [two’s
complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) and made of all 1s: `0b111…​111`.

Performing `&` between a value and `0b111…​111` means applying the `&` operator to each bit of the value
and the bit `1`, resulting in a value equal to the provided one, bit by bit.

    anyValue & -1 // Noncompliant
    anyValue      // Compliant

Similarly, `anyValue | 0` always results in `anyValue`, because the binary representation of `0` is always
`0b000…​000` and the `|` operator returns its first input when the second is `0`.

    anyValue | 0  // Noncompliant
    anyValue      // Compliant

The same applies to `anyValue ^ 0`: the `^` operator returns `1` when its two input bits are different
(`1` and `0` or `0` and `1`) and returns `0` when its two input bits are the same (both
`0` or both `1`). When `^` is applied with `0`, the result would be `1` if the other input is
`1`, because the two input bits are different, and `0` if the other input bit is `0`, because the two input are the
same. That results in returning `anyValue`.

    anyValue ^ 0  // Noncompliant
    anyValue      // Compliant
