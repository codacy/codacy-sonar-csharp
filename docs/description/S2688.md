`NaN` is not equal to anything, even itself. Testing for equality or inequality against `NaN` will yield predictable results, but probably not the ones you want.

Instead, the best way to see whether a variable is equal to `NaN` is to use `Number.isNaN()`, since ES2015, or (perhaps counter-intuitively) to compare it to itself. Since `NaN !== NaN`, when `a !== a`, you know it must equal `NaN`.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    var a = double.NaN;
    
    if (a == double.NaN) // Noncompliant; always false
    {
      Console.WriteLine("a is not a number");  // this is dead code
    }
    if (a != double.NaN)  // Noncompliant; always true
    {
      Console.WriteLine("a is not NaN"); // this statement is not necessarily true
    }


## Compliant Solution


    if (double.IsNaN(a))
    {
      console.log("a is not a number");
    }
