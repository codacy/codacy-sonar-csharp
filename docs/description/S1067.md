The complexity of an expression is defined by the number of `&&`, `||` and `condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse` operators it contains.
 
A single expression’s complexity should not become too high to keep the code readable.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example
 
With the default threshold value of 3

    if (((condition1 && condition2) || (condition3 && condition4)) && condition5) { ... }

## Compliant Solution

    if ((MyFirstCondition() || MySecondCondition()) && MyLastCondition()) { ... }
