`Thread.Suspend` and `Thread.Resume` can give unpredictable results, and both methods have been deprecated. Indeed, if `Thread.Suspend` is not used very carefully, a thread can be suspended while holding a lock, thus leading to a deadlock. Other safer synchronization mechanisms should be used, such as `Monitor`, `Mutex`, and `Semaphore`.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // ...
      Thread.CurrentThread.Suspend(); // Noncompliant
      Thread.CurrentThread.Resume(); // Noncompliant
    }
