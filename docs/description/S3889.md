## Why is this an issue?

`Thread.Suspend` and `Thread.Resume` can give unpredictable results, and both methods have been deprecated. Indeed, if
`Thread.Suspend` is not used very carefully, a [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29) can be suspended while
holding a [lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_%28computer_science%29), thus leading to a [deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock).

There are other synchronization mechanisms that are safer and should be used instead, such as:

-  `Monitor` provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects.
-  `Mutex` provides a mechanism that synchronizes interprocess access to a protected resource.
-  `Semaphore` provides a mechanism that allows limiting the number of threads that have access to a protected resources concurrently.
-  `Events` enable a class to notify others when something of interest occurs.
