[Strong cipher algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_cryptography) are cryptographic systems resistant to cryptanalysis, they are not vulnerable to well-known attacks like brute force attacks for example.

A general recommendation is to only use cipher algorithms intensively tested and promoted by the cryptographic community.

More specifically for block cipher, it's not recommended to use algorithm with a block size inferior than 128 bits.

## Noncompliant Code Example

For [System.Security.Cryptography](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=netcore-3.1) library, these old cryptographic algorithms should no longer be used for any reason:


    var tripleDES1 = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider(); // Noncompliant: Triple DES is vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack
    
    var simpleDES = new DESCryptoServiceProvider(); // Noncompliant: DES works with 56-bit keys allow attacks via exhaustive search
    
    var RC2 = new RC2CryptoServiceProvider(); // Noncompliant: RC2 is vulnerable to a related-key attack


For Bouncycastle library, [AESFastEngine has a side channel leak](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000339), it is possible to gain information about the key used to initialize the cipher:


    AesFastEngine aesFast = new AesFastEngine(); // Noncompliant


## Compliant Solution

For [System.Security.Cryptography](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=netcore-3.1) library, it's recommended to use `AesCryptoServiceProvider`:


    var AES = new AesCryptoServiceProvider(); // Compliant


For Bouncycastle library, it's recommended to use `AESEngine`:


    var AES = new AESEngine(); // Compliant
