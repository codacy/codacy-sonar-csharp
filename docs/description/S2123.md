A value that is incremented or decremented and then not stored is at best wasted code and at worst a bug.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    public int PickNumber()
    {
      int i = 0;
      int j = 0;
    
      i = i++; // Noncompliant; i is still zero
    
      return j++; // Noncompliant; 0 returned
    }


## Compliant Solution


    public int PickNumber()
    {
      int i = 0;
      int j = 0;
    
      i++;
      return ++j;
    }
