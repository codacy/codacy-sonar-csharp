## Why is this an issue?

[GC.Collect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.collect) is a method that forces or suggests to the [garbage collector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/) to run a collection of objects in the managed heap
that are no longer being used and free their memory.

Calling `GC.Collect` is rarely necessary and can significantly affect application performance. That’s because it is a [tracing garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection) and needs to examine *every object in memory* for
cleanup and analyze all reachable objects from every application’s root (static fields, local variables on thread stacks, etc.).

To perform tracing and memory releasing correctly, the garbage collection [may](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/latency) need to block all threads currently in execution. That is
why, as a general rule, the [performance implications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/performance#troubleshoot-performance-issues)
of calling `GC.Collect` far outweigh the benefits.

This rule raises an issue when any overload of `Collect` is invoked.

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // ...
      GC.Collect();                              // Noncompliant
      GC.Collect(2, GCCollectionMode.Optimized); // Noncompliant
    }

There may be exceptions to this rule: for example, you’ve just triggered some event that is unique in the run of your program that caused a lot of
long-lived objects to die, and you want to release their memory.
