Catching `System.Exception` seems like an efficient way to handle multiple possible exceptions. Unfortunately, it traps all exception<br>types, including the ones that were not intended to be caught. To prevent any misunderstandings, the exception filters should be used. Alternatively<br>each exception type should be in a separate `catch` block.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    try
    {
      // do something that might throw a FileNotFoundException or IOException
    }
    catch (Exception e) // Noncompliant
    {
      // log exception ...
    }


## Compliant Solution


    try
    {
      // do something
    }
    catch (Exception e) when (e is FileNotFoundException || e is IOException)
    {
      // do something
    }


## Exceptions

The final option is to catch `System.Exception` and `throw` it in the last statement in the `catch` block. This is<br>the least-preferred option, as it is an old-style code, which also suffers from performance penalty compared to exception filters.


    try
    {
      // do something
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      if (e is FileNotFoundException || e is IOException)
      {
        // do something
      }
      else
      {
        throw;
      }
    }
