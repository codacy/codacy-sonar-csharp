## Why is this an issue?
 
In most logging frameworks, itâ€™s good practice to set the logger name to match its enclosing type, as enforced by {rule:csharpsquid:S3416}.
 
Logging frameworks can define or use [Generic interfaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/interfaces) for the logger, such as [`ILogger<TCategoryName>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1).
 
The use of a logger of a generic type parameter `A` (e.g. `ILogger<A>`) in a type different than `A`, say `B`, goes against the convention.
 
Because the instance of type `A` would log with a logger named after `B`, log items would appear as if they were logged by `B` instead, resulting in confusion and logging misconfiguration:
 
- overriding defaults for the logger named after `A` would not take effect for entries logged in the type `A`
- fine-graned logging configuration would not be possible, since there would be no way to distinguish entries logged in the type `A`
  from entries logged in the type `B`

Further details and examples are provided in {rule:csharpsquid:S3416}.

    class EnclosingType
    {
        public EnclosingType(ILogger<AnotherType> logger) // Noncompliant
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

To fix that, the generic type parameter of the `ILogger` interface should match the enclosing type.

    class EnclosingType
    {
        public EnclosingType(ILogger<EnclosingType> logger) // Compliant
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

This rule specifically targets the generic logging interface [`ILogger<TCategoryName>` Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1) defined by [Microsoft Extensions Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging).
