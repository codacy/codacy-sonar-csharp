The access control of an application must be properly implemented in order to restrict access to resources to authorized entities otherwise this could lead to vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2018-12999](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12999)
- [CVE-2018-10285](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10285)
- [CVE-2017-7455](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7455)


Granting correct permissions to users, applications, groups or roles and defining required permissions that allow access to a resource is sensitive, must therefore be done with care. For instance, it is obvious that only users with administrator privilege should be authorized to add/remove the administrator permission of another user.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- Granted permission to an entity (user, application) allow access to information or functionalities not needed by this entity.
- Privileges are easily acquired (eg: based on the location of the user, type of device used, defined by third parties, does not require approval<br>  ...).
- Inherited permission, default permission, no privileges (eg: anonymous user) is authorized to access to a protected resource.


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

At minimum, an access control system should:

- Use a well-defined access control model like [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) or [ACL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list).
- Entities' permissions should be reviewed regularly to remove permissions that are no longer needed.
- Respect [the principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) ("\_an entity has access only<br>  the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose\_").


## Sensitive Code Example


    using System.Threading;
    using System.Security.Permissions;
    using System.Security.Principal;
    using System.IdentityModel.Tokens;
    
    class SecurityPrincipalDemo
    {
        class MyIdentity : IIdentity // Sensitive, custom IIdentity implementations should be reviewed
        {
            // ...
        }
    
        class MyPrincipal : IPrincipal // Sensitive, custom IPrincipal implementations should be reviewed
        {
            // ...
        }
        [System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Role = "Administrators")] // Sensitive. The access restrictions enforced by this attribute should be reviewed.
        static void CheckAdministrator()
        {
            WindowsIdentity MyIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent(); // Sensitive
            HttpContext.User = ...; // Sensitive: review all reference (set and get) to System.Web HttpContext.User
            AppDomain domain = AppDomain.CurrentDomain;
            domain.SetPrincipalPolicy(PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal); // Sensitive
            MyIdentity identity = new MyIdentity(); // Sensitive
            MyPrincipal MyPrincipal = new MyPrincipal(MyIdentity); // Sensitive
            Thread.CurrentPrincipal = MyPrincipal; // Sensitive
            domain.SetThreadPrincipal(MyPrincipal); // Sensitive
    
            // All instantiation of PrincipalPermission should be reviewed.
            PrincipalPermission principalPerm = new PrincipalPermission(null, "Administrators"); // Sensitive
            principalPerm.Demand();
    
            SecurityTokenHandler handler = ...;
            // Sensitive: this creates an identity.
            ReadOnlyCollection<ClaimsIdentity> identities = handler.ValidateToken(â€¦);
        }
    
         // Sensitive: review how this function uses the identity and principal.
        void modifyPrincipal(MyIdentity identity, MyPrincipal principal)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
