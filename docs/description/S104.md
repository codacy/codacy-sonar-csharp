A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to<br>maintain. Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller pieces of code which focus on well defined tasks. Those<br>smaller files will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.
