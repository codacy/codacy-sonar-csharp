## Why is this an issue?
 
When exceptions occur, it is usually a bad idea to simply ignore them. Instead, it is better to handle them properly, or at least to log them.
 
This rule only reports on empty catch clauses that catch generic `Exception`s.
 
### Noncompliant code example

    string text = "";
    try
    {
        text = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
    }
    catch (Exception exc) // Noncompliant
    {
    }

### Compliant solution

    string text = "";
    try
    {
        text = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
    }
    catch (Exception exc)
    {
        logger.Log(exc);
    }

### Exceptions
 
When a block contains a comment, it is not considered to be empty.
