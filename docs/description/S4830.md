Validation of X.509 certificates is essential to create secure SSL/TLS sessions not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

The certificate chain validation includes these steps:

- The certificate is issued by its parent Certificate Authority or the root CA trusted by the system.
- Each CA is allowed to issue certificates.
- Each certificate in the chain is not expired.


It's not recommended to reinvent the wheel by implementing custom certificate chain validation.

TLS libraries provide built-in certificate validation functions that should be used.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback +=
        (sender, certificate, chain, errors) =&gt; {
            return true; // Noncompliant: trust all certificates
        };


## Compliant Solution


    ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback +=
        (sender, certificate, chain, errors) =&gt;
        {
            if (development) return true; // for development, trust all certificates
            return errors == SslPolicyErrors.None
                &amp;&amp; validCerts.Contains(certificate.GetCertHashString()); // Compliant: trust only some certificates
        };
