Nested `switch` structures are difficult to understand because you can easily confuse the cases of an inner `switch` as belonging to an outer statement. Therefore nested `switch` statements should be avoided.
 
Specifically, you should structure your code to avoid the need for nested `switch` statements, but if you cannot, then consider moving the inner `switch` to another function.
