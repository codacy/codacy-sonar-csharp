Beginning with C# 7, it is possible to add underscores ('\_') to numeric literals to enhance readability. The addition of underscores in this manner<br>has no semantic meaning, but makes it easier for maintainers to understand the code.

The number of digits to the left of a decimal point needed to trigger this rule varies by base.


| Base |  Minimum digits |
| --- | --- |
| binary |  9  |
| decimal |  6  |
| hexadecimal |  9  |


It is only the presence of underscores, not their spacing that is scrutinized by this rule.

**Note** that this rule is automatically disabled when the project's `C# version` is lower than `7`.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    int i = 10000000;  // Noncompliant; is this 10 million or 100 million?
    int  j = 0b01101001010011011110010101011110;  // Noncompliant
    long l = 0x7fffffffffffffffL;  // Noncompliant


## Compliant Solution


    int i = 10_000_000;
    int  j = 0b01101001_01001101_11100101_01011110;
    long l = 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffffL;
