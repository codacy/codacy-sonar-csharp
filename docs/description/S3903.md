Types are declared in namespaces in order to prevent name collisions and as a way to organize them into the object hierarchy. Types that are defined outside any named namespace are in a global namespace that cannot be referenced in code.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    public class Foo // Noncompliant
    {
    }
    
    public struct Bar // Noncompliant
    {
    }


## Compliant Solution


    namespace SomeSpace
    {
        public class Foo
        {
        }
    
        public struct Bar
        {
        }
    }
