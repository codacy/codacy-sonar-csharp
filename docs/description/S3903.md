Types are declared in namespaces in order to prevent name collisions and as a way to organize them into the object hierarchy. Types that are
defined outside any named namespace are in a global namespace that cannot be referenced in code.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
public class Foo // Noncompliant
{
}

public struct Bar // Noncompliant
{
}
</pre>
