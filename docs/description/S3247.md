Because the `is` operator performs a cast if the object is not null, using `is` to check type and then casting the same argument to that type, necessarily performs two casts. The same result can be achieved more efficiently with a single cast using `as`, followed by a null-check.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    if (x is Fruit)  // Noncompliant
    {
      var f = (Fruit)x; // or x as Fruit
      // ...
    }

## Compliant Solution

    // C# 6
    var f = x as Fruit;
    if (f != null)
    {
      // ...
    }
    // C# 7
    if (x is Fruit fruit)
    {
      // ...
    }
