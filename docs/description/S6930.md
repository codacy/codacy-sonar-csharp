Backslash characters (`\`) should be avoided in [route templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#route-templates).
 
## Why is this an issue?
 
[Routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/routing) in ASP.NET MVC maps [controllers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/actions#what-is-a-controller) and [actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/actions#defining-actions) to paths in request [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).
 
In the former syntax specification of URIs, backslash characters (`\`) were not allowed at all (see [section "2.4.3. Excluded US-ASCII Characters" of RFC 2396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396/#section-2.4.3)). While the current specification ([RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)) doesn’t include anymore the "Excluded US-ASCII Characters" section, most URL processors still don’t support backslash properly.
 
For instance, a backslash in the ["path" part](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) of a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax) is automatically converted to a forward slash (`/`) both by Chrome and Internet Explorer (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10438008)).
 
As an example, `\Calculator\Evaluate?expression=3\4` is converted on the fly into `/Calculator/Evaluate?expression=3\4` before the HTTP request is made to the server.
 
While backslashes are allowed in the "query" part of a URL, and it’s common to have them as part of a complex query expression, the route of a controller is always part of the "path".
 
That is why the use of backslashes in controller templates should be avoided in general.
 
### What is the potential impact?
 
A backslash in the route pattern of a controller would only make sense if the developer intended the backslash in the route to be explicitly escaped by the user, using [`%5C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Character_data).
 
For example, the route `Something\[controller]` for the `HomeController` would need to be called as `Something%5CHome`.
 
The validity of such a scenario is unlikely and the resulting behavior is surprising.
 
## How to fix it
 
### Code examples
 
#### Noncompliant code example

    [Route(@"Something\[controller]")] // Noncompliant: Replace '\' with '/'.
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult Index() => View();
    }

#### Compliant solution

    [Route(@"Something/[controller]")] // '\' replaced with '/'
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult Index() => View();
    }

#### Noncompliant code example

    app.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}\\{action=Index}"); // Noncompliant: Replace '\' with '/'.

#### Compliant solution

    app.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}"); // '\' replaced with '/'
