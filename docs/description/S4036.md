When executing an OS command and unless you specify the full path to the executable, then the locations in your applicationâ€™s `PATH` environment variable will be searched for the executable. That search could leave an opening for an attacker if one of the elements in `PATH` is a directory under his control.
 
## Ask Yourself Whether
 
- The directories in the PATH environment variable may be defined by not trusted entities.

There is a risk if you answered yes to this question.
 
## Recommended Secure Coding Practices
 
Fully qualified/absolute path should be used to specify the OS command to execute.
 
## Sensitive Code Example

    Process p = new Process();
    p.StartInfo.FileName = "binary"; // Sensitive

## Compliant Solution

    Process p = new Process();
    p.StartInfo.FileName = @"C:\Apps\binary.exe"; // Compliant
