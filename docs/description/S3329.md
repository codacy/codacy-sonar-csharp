In encryption, when Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is used, the Initialization Vector (IV) must be random and unpredictable. Otherwise, the encrypted value is vulnerable to crypto-analysis attacks such as the "Chosen-Plaintext Attack".

An IV value should be associated to one, and only one encryption cycle, because the IV's purpose is to ensure that the same plaintext encrypted twice will yield two different ciphertexts.

To that end, IV's should be:

- random
- unpredictable
- publishable (IVs are frequently published)
- authenticated, along with the ciphertext, with a Message Authentication Code (MAC)


This rule raises an issue when the IV is hard-coded.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    public void Encrypt(byte[] key, byte[] data, MemoryStream target)
    {
        byte[] initializationVector = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 };
    
        using var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider();
        var encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(key, initializationVector); // Noncompliant, hardcoded value is used
    
        using var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(target, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cryptoStream.Write(data);
    }


## Compliant Solution


    public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] key, byte[] data, MemoryStream target)
    {
        using var aes = new AesCryptoServiceProvider();
        var encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor(key, aes.IV); // aes.IV is automatically generated to random secure value
    
        using var cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(target, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cryptoStream.Write(data);
    
        return aes.IV;
    }
