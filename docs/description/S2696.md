This rule raises an issue each time a `static` field is updated from a non-static method or property.
 
## Why is this an issue?
 
Updating a `static` field from a non-`static` method introduces significant challenges and potential bugs. Multiple class instances and threads can access and modify the `static` field concurrently, leading to unintended consequences for other instances or threads (unexpected behavior, [race conditions](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/1d42da/race-conditions-in-threading-C-Sharp/) and synchronization problems).

    class MyClass
    {
      private static int count = 0;
    
      public void DoSomething()
      {
        //...
        count++;  // Noncompliant: make the enclosing instance property 'static' or remove this set on the 'static' field.
      }
    }
    
    interface MyInterface
    {
      private static int count = 0;
    
      public void DoSomething()
      {
        //...
        count++;  // Noncompliant: remove this set, which updates a 'static' field from an instance method.
      }
    }
