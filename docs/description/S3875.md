## Why is this an issue?

The use of `==` to compare two objects is expected to do a reference comparison. That is, it is expected to return `true` if
and only if they are the same object instance. Overloading the operator to do anything else will inevitably lead to the introduction of bugs by
callers.

    public static bool operator ==(MyType x, MyType y) // Noncompliant: confusing for the caller
    {
        // custom implementation
    }

On the other hand, overloading it to do exactly that is pointless; that’s what `==` does by default.

    public static bool operator ==(MyType x, MyType y) // Noncompliant: redundant
    {
        if (x == null)
        {
            return y == null;
        }
    
        return object.ReferenceEquals(x,y);
    }

### Exceptions

-   Classes with overloaded `operator +` or `operator -` are ignored.
-   Classes that implement `IComparable<T>` or `IEquatable<T>` most probably behave as value-type objects and are
  ignored.
