The use of operators pairs ( `=+`, `=-` or `=!` ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (`+=`,
`-=` or `!=`) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.

This rule raises an issue when `=+`, `=-`, or `=!` is used without any spacing between the two operators and when
there is at least one whitespace character after.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target =- num;  // Noncompliant; target = -3\. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num; // Noncompliant; target = 3
</pre>

## Compliant Solution

<pre>
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target = -num;  // Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num;
</pre>
