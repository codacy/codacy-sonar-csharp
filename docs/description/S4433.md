An un-authenticated LDAP connection can lead to transactions without access control. Authentication, and with it, access control, are the last line of defense against LDAP injections and should not be disabled.

This rule raises an issue when an LDAP connection is created with `AuthenticationTypes.Anonymous` or `AuthenticationTypes.None`.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    DirectoryEntry myDirectoryEntry = new DirectoryEntry(adPath);
    myDirectoryEntry.AuthenticationType = AuthenticationTypes.None; // Noncompliant
    
    DirectoryEntry myDirectoryEntry = new DirectoryEntry(adPath, "u", "p", AuthenticationTypes.None); // Noncompliant


## Compliant Solution


    DirectoryEntry myDirectoryEntry = new DirectoryEntry(myADSPath); // Compliant; default DirectoryEntry.AuthenticationType property value is "Secure" since .NET Framework 2.0
    
    DirectoryEntry myDirectoryEntry = new DirectoryEntry(myADSPath, "u", "p", AuthenticationTypes.Secure);
