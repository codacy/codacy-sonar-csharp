## Why is this an issue?
 
According to the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), methods returning either a `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` or a `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult>` are considered "asynchronous". Such methods should use the `Async` suffix. Conversely methods which do not return such Tasks should not have an "Async" suffix in their names.
 
### Noncompliant code example

    using System;
    using  System.Threading.Tasks;
    
    namespace myLibrary
    {
    
      public class Foo
      {
        public Task Read(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count, // Noncompliant
                                    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      }
    }

### Compliant solution

    using System;
    using  System.Threading.Tasks;
    
    namespace myLibrary
    {
    
      public class Foo
      {
        public Task ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      }
    }

### Exceptions
 
This rule doesn’t raise an issue when the method is an override or part of the implementation of an interface since it can not be renamed.
