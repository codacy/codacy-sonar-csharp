A dead store happens when a local variable is assigned a value that is not read by any subsequent instruction. Calculating or retrieving a value only to then overwrite it or throw it away, could indicate a serious error in the code. Even if itâ€™s not an error, it is at best a waste of resources. Therefore all calculated values should be used.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    i = a + b; // Noncompliant; calculation result not used before value is overwritten
    i = compute();

## Compliant Solution

    i = a + b;
    i += compute();

## Exceptions
 
No issue is reported when
 
- the analyzed method body contains `try` blocks,
- a lambda expression captures the local variables, or
- the variable is unused (case covered by Rule {rule:csharpsquid:S1481})
- initializations to `-1`, `0`, `1`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `""`
  and `string.Empty`.
