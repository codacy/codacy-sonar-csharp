A dead store happens when a local variable is assigned a value that is not read by any subsequent instruction. Calculating or retrieving a value only to then overwrite it or throw it away, could indicate a serious error in the code. Even if it's not an error, it is at best a waste of resources. Therefore all calculated values should be used.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    i = a + b; // Noncompliant; calculation result not used before value is overwritten
    i = compute();


## Compliant Solution


    i = a + b;
    i += compute();


## Exceptions

No issue is reported when

- the analyzed method body contains `try` blocks,
- a lambda expression captures the local variables, or
- the variable is unused (case covered by Rule S1481)
- initializations to `-1`, `0`, `1`, `null`, `true`, `false`, `""`
  and `string.Empty`.
