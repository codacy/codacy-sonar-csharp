## Why is this an issue?

Naming the members of an inner class the same as the static members of its enclosing class is possible but generally considered a bad practice.
That’s because maintainers may be confused about which members are being used in a given context. Instead the inner class member should be given
distinct and descriptive name, and all references to it should be updated accordingly.

    class Outer
    {
      public static int A;
    
      public class Inner
      {
        public int A; // Noncompliant
    
        public int MyProp
        {
          get => A; // Returns inner A. Was that intended?
        }
      }
    }

Here’s an example of compliant code after renaming the inner class member, this way the property will return the `Outer` A:

    class Outer
    {
      public static int A;
    
      public class Inner
      {
        public int B; // Compliant
    
        public int MyProp
        {
          get => A; // Returns outer A
        }
      }
    }

Or if you want to reference the `Inner` A field:

    class Outer
    {
      public static int B;
    
      public class Inner
      {
        public int A; // Compliant
    
        public int MyProp
        {
          get => A; // Returns inner A
        }
      }
    }
