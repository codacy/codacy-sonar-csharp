## Why is this an issue?
 
Creating objects that are not used is a vulnerability that can lead to unexpected behavior.
 
If this was done intentionally due to side effects in the objectâ€™s constructor, the code should be moved to a dedicated method.
 
## How to fix it
 
### Code examples
 
#### Noncompliant code example

    public void Method(MyObject myObject)
    {
        if (myObject is null)
        {
            new MyObject(); // Noncompliant
        }
    
        if (myObject.IsCorrupted)
        {
            new ArgumentException($"{nameof(myObject)} is corrupted"); // Noncompliant
        }
    
        // ...
    }

#### Compliant solution

    public void Method(MyObject myObject)
    {
        if (myObject is null)
        {
            myObject = new MyObject(); // Compliant
        }
    
        if (myObject.IsCorrupted)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException($"{nameof(myObject)} is corrupted"); // Compliant
        }
    
        // ...
    }
