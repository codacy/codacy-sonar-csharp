The rule targets the use of `DateTime.Now` call followed by some arithmetic operation.

## Why is this an issue?

Using `DateTime.Now` calls within a subtraction operation to measure elapsed time is not recommended. This property is subject to
changes such as daylight savings transitions, which can invalidate the calculation if the change occurs during the benchmark session, or when updating
a timer. Moreover, `DateTime.Now` is dependent on the system clock, which may have low resolution on older systems (as low as 15
milliseconds).

## How to fix it

### Code examples

If the purpose is to benchmark something then, instead of the `DateTime.Now` property, itâ€™s recommended to use `Stopwatch`,
which is not affected by changes in time such as daylight savings (DST) and automatically checks for the existence of high-precision timers. As a
bonus, the `StopWatch` class is also lightweight and computationally faster than `DateTime`.

#### Noncompliant code example

    var start = DateTime.Now; // First call, on March 26th 2:59 am
    MethodToBeBenchmarked();
    
    Console.WriteLine($"{(DateTime.Now - start).TotalMilliseconds} ms"); // Second call happens 2 minutes later but `Now` is March 26th, 4:01 am as there's a shift to summer time

#### Compliant solution

    var stopWatch = Stopwatch.StartNew(); // Compliant
    MethodToBeBenchmarked();
    stopWatch.Stop();
    
    Console.WriteLine($"{stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

If, on the other hand, the goal is to refresh a timer prefer using the `DateTime.UtcNow` property, which guarantees reliable results
when doing arithmetic operations during DST transitions.

#### Noncompliant code example

    if ((DateTime.Now - lastRefresh).TotalMilliseconds > MinRefreshInterval)
    {
        lastRefresh = DateTime.Now;
        // Refresh
    }

#### Compliant solution

    if ((DateTime.UtcNow - lastRefresh).TotalMilliseconds > MinRefreshInterval)
    {
        lastRefresh = DateTime.UtcNow;
        // Refresh
    }
