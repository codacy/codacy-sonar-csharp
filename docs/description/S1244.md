Floating point math is imprecise because of the challenges of storing such values in a binary representation. Even worse, floating point math is<br>not associative; push a `float` or a `double` through a series of simple mathematical operations and the answer will be<br>different based on the order of those operation because of the rounding that takes place at each step.

Even simple floating point assignments are not simple:


    float f = 0.100000001f; // 0.1
    double d = 0.10000000000000001; // 0.1


(Results will vary based on compiler and compiler settings)

Therefore, the use of the equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) operators on `float` or `double` values<br>is almost always an error.

This rule checks for the use of direct and indirect equality/inequality tests on floats and doubles.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    float myNumber = 3.146f;
    if ( myNumber == 3.146f ) //Noncompliant. Because of floating point imprecision, this will be false
    {
      // ...
    }
    
    if (myNumber &lt;= 3.146f &amp;&amp; mNumber &gt;= 3.146f) // Noncompliant indirect equality test
    {
      // ...
    }
    
    if (myNumber &lt; 4 || myNumber &gt; 4) // Noncompliant indirect inequality test
    {
      // ...
    }
