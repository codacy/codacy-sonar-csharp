A `catch` clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the `catch` altogether and letting it bubble up automatically, but with more code and the additional detriment of leaving maintainers scratching their heads.
 
Such clauses should either be eliminated or populated with the appropriate logic.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    string s = "";
    try
    {
      s = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
    }
    catch (Exception e)  // Noncompliant
    {
      throw;
    }

## Compliant Solution

    string s = "";
    try
    {
      s = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
    }
    catch (Exception e) // Compliant
    {
      logger.LogError(e);
      throw;
    }

or

    string s = File.ReadAllText(fileName);

## Exceptions
 
This rule will not generate issues for `catch` blocks with just `throw` inside if they are followed by a `catch` block for a more general exception type that does more than just rethrowing the exception.

    var s = ""
    try
    {
        s = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
    }
    catch (IOException) // Compliant, if removed will change the logic
    {
        throw;
    }
    catch (Exception)  // Compliant, does more than just rethrow
    {
        logger.LogError(e);
        throw;
    }
