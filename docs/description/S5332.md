Clear-text protocols as `ftp`, `telnet` or non secure `http` are lacking encryption of transported data. They are also missing the capability to build an authenticated connection. This mean that any attacker who can sniff traffic from the network can read, modify or corrupt the transported content. These protocol are not secure as they expose applications to a large range of risk:

- Sensitive data exposure
- Traffic redirected to a malicious endpoint
- Malware infected software update or installer
- Execution of client side code
- Corruption of critical information


Note also that using the `http` protocol is being deprecated by [major web browser](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http).

In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2019-6169](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6169)
- [CVE-2019-12327](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12327)
- [CVE-2019-11065](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11065)


## Ask Yourself Whether

- The confidentiality and integrity of data is necessary in the context of the web application.
- The data is exchanged on an exposed network (Internet, public network etc).


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- Use `ssh` as an alternative to `telnet`
- Use `sftp`, `scp` or `ftps` instead of `ftp`
- Use `https` instead of `http`
- Use `SMTP` over `SSL/TLS` or `SMTP` with `STARTTLS` instead of clear-text SMTP


It is recommended to secure all transport channels (event local network) as it can take a single non secure connection to compromise an entire application or system.

## Sensitive Code Example


    var urlHttp = "http://example.com";                 // Noncompliant
    var urlFtp = "ftp://anonymous@example.com";         // Noncompliant
    var urlTelnet = "telnet://anonymous@example.com";   // Noncompliant



    using var smtp = new SmtpClient("host", 25); // Noncompliant, EnableSsl is not set
    using var telnet = new MyTelnet.Client("host", port); // Noncompliant, rule raises Security Hotspot on any member containing "Telnet"


## Compliant Solution


    var urlHttps = "https://example.com";
    var urlSftp = "sftp://anonymous@example.com";
    var urlSsh = "ssh://anonymous@example.com";



    using var smtp = new SmtpClient("host", 25) { EnableSsl = true };
    using var ssh = new MySsh.Client("host", port);


## Exceptions

No issue is reported for the following cases because they are not considered sensitive:

- Insecure protocol scheme followed by loopback addresses like 127.0.0.1 or `localhost`
