Not surprisingly, the `SafeHandle.DangerousGetHandle` method is dangerous. That’s because it may not return a valid handle. Using it can lead to leaks and vulnerabilities. While it is possible to use the method successfully, it’s extremely difficult to do correctly, so the method should simply be avoided altogether.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        System.Reflection.FieldInfo fieldInfo = ...;
        SafeHandle handle = (SafeHandle)fieldInfo.GetValue(rKey);
        IntPtr dangerousHandle = handle.DangerousGetHandle();  // Noncompliant
    }
