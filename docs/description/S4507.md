Delivering code in production with debug features activated is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:

- [CVE-2018-1999007](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1999007)
- [CVE-2015-5306](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5306)
- [CVE-2013-2006](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2006)


An application's debug features enable developers to find bugs more easily. It often gives access to detailed information on both the system<br>running the application and users. Sometime it even enables the execution of custom commands. Thus deploying on production servers an application<br>which has debug features activated is extremely dangerous.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- the code or configuration enabling the application debug features is deployed on production servers.
- the application runs by default with debug features activated.


You are at risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

Do not enable debug features on production servers.

The .Net Core framework offers multiple features which help during debug.<br>`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDeveloperExceptionPage` and<br>`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDatabaseErrorPage` are two of them. Make sure that those features are disabled in<br>production.

Use `if (env.IsDevelopment())` to disable debug code.

## Sensitive Code Example

This rule raises issues when the following .Net Core methods are called:<br>`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDeveloperExceptionPage`,<br>`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.UseDatabaseErrorPage`. No Issue is raised when those calls are disabled by `if
(env.IsDevelopment())`.


    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    
    namespace mvcApp
    {
        public class Startup2
        {
            public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
            {
                if (env.IsDevelopment())
                {
                    // The following calls are ok because they are disabled in production
                    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
                    app.UseDatabaseErrorPage();
                }
                // Those calls are Sensitive because it seems that they will run in production
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); // Sensitive
                app.UseDatabaseErrorPage(); // Sensitive
            }
        }
    }


## Exceptions

This rule does not analyze configuration files. Make sure that debug mode is not enabled by default in those files.
