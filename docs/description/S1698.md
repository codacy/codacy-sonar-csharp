Using the equality `==` and inequality `!=` operators to compare two objects generally works. The operators can be<br>overloaded, and therefore the comparison can resolve to the appropriate method. However, when the operators are used on interface instances, then<br>`==` resolves to reference equality, which may result in unexpected behavior if implementing classes override `Equals`.<br>Similarly, when a class overrides `Equals`, but instances are compared with non-overloaded `==`, there is a high chance that<br>value comparison was meant instead of the reference one.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    public interface IMyInterface
    {
    }
    
    public class MyClass : IMyInterface
    {
        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            //...
        }
    }
    
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Method(IMyInterface instance1, IMyInterface instance2)
        {
            if (instance1 == instance2) // Noncompliant, will do reference equality check, but was that intended? MyClass overrides Equals.
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Equal");
            }
        }
    }


## Compliant Solution


    public interface IMyInterface
    {
    }
    
    public class MyClass : IMyInterface
    {
        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            //...
        }
    }
    
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Method(IMyInterface instance1, IMyInterface instance2)
        {
            if (object.Equals(instance1, instance2)) // object.Equals checks for null and then calls the instance based Equals, so MyClass.Equals
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Equal");
            }
        }
    }


## Exceptions

The rule does not report on comparisons of `System.Type` instances and on comparisons inside `Equals` overrides.

It also does not raise an issue when one of the operands is `null` nor when one of the operand is cast to `object` (because<br>in this case we want to ensure reference equality even if some `==` overload is present).
