Successful Zip Bomb attacks occur when an application expands untrusted archive files without controlling the size of the expanded data, which can lead to denial of service. A Zip bomb is usually a malicious archive file of a few kilobytes of compressed data but turned into gigabytes of uncompressed data. To achieve this extreme [compression ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio), attackers will compress irrelevant data (eg: a long string of repeated bytes).
 
## Ask Yourself Whether
 
Archives to expand are untrusted and:
 
- There is no validation of the number of entries in the archive.
- There is no validation of the total size of the uncompressed data.
- There is no validation of the ratio between the compressed and uncompressed archive entry.

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.
 
## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- Define and control the ratio between compressed and uncompressed data, in general the data compression ratio for most of the legit archives is
  1 to 3.
- Define and control the threshold for maximum total size of the uncompressed data.
- Count the number of file entries extracted from the archive and abort the extraction if their number is greater than a predefined threshold, in
  particular itâ€™s not recommended to recursively expand archives (an entry of an archive could be also an archive).

## Sensitive Code Example

    using var zipToOpen = new FileStream(@"ZipBomb.zip", FileMode.Open);
    using var archive = new ZipArchive(zipToOpen, ZipArchiveMode.Read);
    foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in archive.Entries)
    {
      entry.ExtractToFile("./output_onlyfortesting.txt", true); // Sensitive
    }

## Compliant Solution

    int THRESHOLD_ENTRIES = 10000;
    int THRESHOLD_SIZE = 1000000000; // 1 GB
    double THRESHOLD_RATIO = 10;
    int totalSizeArchive = 0;
    int totalEntryArchive = 0;
    
    using var zipToOpen = new FileStream(@"ZipBomb.zip", FileMode.Open);
    using var archive = new ZipArchive(zipToOpen, ZipArchiveMode.Read);
    foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in archive.Entries)
    {
      totalEntryArchive ++;
    
      using (Stream st = entry.Open())
      {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int totalSizeEntry = 0;
        int numBytesRead = 0;
    
        do
        {
          numBytesRead = st.Read(buffer, 0, 1024);
          totalSizeEntry += numBytesRead;
          totalSizeArchive += numBytesRead;
          double compressionRatio = totalSizeEntry / entry.CompressedLength;
    
          if(compressionRatio > THRESHOLD_RATIO) {
            // ratio between compressed and uncompressed data is highly suspicious, looks like a Zip Bomb Attack
            break;
          }
        }
        while (numBytesRead > 0);
      }
    
      if(totalSizeArchive > THRESHOLD_SIZE) {
          // the uncompressed data size is too much for the application resource capacity
          break;
      }
    
      if(totalEntryArchive > THRESHOLD_ENTRIES) {
          // too much entries in this archive, can lead to inodes exhaustion of the system
          break;
      }
    }
