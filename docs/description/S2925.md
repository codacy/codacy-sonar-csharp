## Why is this an issue?
 
Using `Thread.Sleep` in a test might introduce unpredictable and inconsistent results depending on the environment. Furthermore, it will block the [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29), which means the system resources are not being fully used.

    [TestMethod]
    public void SomeTest()
    {
        Thread.Sleep(500); // Noncompliant
        // assertions...
    }

An alternative is a task-based asynchronous approach, using [async and await](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/).
 
More specifically the [Task.Delay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.delay) method should be used, because of the following advantages:
 
- It is **asynchronous**: The thread will not be blocked, but instead will be reused by other operations
- It is more **precise** in timing the delay than `Thread.Sleep`
- It can be **canceled and continued**, which gives more flexibility and control in the timing of your code

    [TestMethod]
    public async Task SomeTest()
    {
        await Task.Delay(500);
        // assertions...
    }

Another scenario is when some data might need to be mocked using [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4), and a delay needs to be introduced:

    [TestMethod]
    public void UserService_Test()
    {
        var userService = new Mock<UserService>();
        var expected = new User();
    
        userService
            .Setup(m => m.GetUserById(42))
            .Returns(() =>
            {
                Thread.Sleep(500); // Noncompliant
                return Task.FromResult(expected);
            });
    
        // assertions...
    }

An alternative to `Thread.Sleep` while mocking with `Moq` is to use `ReturnsAsync` and pass the amount of time to delay there:

    [TestMethod]
    public void UserService_Test()
    {
        var userService = new Mock<UserService>();
        var expected = new User();
    
        userService
            .Setup(m => m.GetUserById(42))
            .ReturnsAsync(expected, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500));
    
        // assertions...
    }
