In cryptography, a "salt" is an extra piece of data which is included when hashing a password. This makes `rainbow-table attacks` more difficult. Using a cryptographic hash function without an unpredictable salt increases the likelihood that an attacker could successfully find the hash value in databases of precomputed hashes (called `rainbow-tables`).

This rule raises an issue when a hashing function which has been specifically designed for hashing passwords, such as `PBKDF2`, is used with a non-random, reused or too short salt value. It does not raise an issue on base hashing algorithms such as `sha1` or `md5` as they should not be used to hash passwords.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- Use hashing functions generating their own secure salt or generate a secure random value of at least 16 bytes.
- The salt should be unique by user password.


## Noncompliant Code Example


    public void Hash(string password)
    {
        var salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hardcoded salt");
        var fromHardcoded = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);     // Noncompliant, salt is hardcoded
    
        salt = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password);
        var fromPassword = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);     // Noncompliant, password should not be used as a salt as it makes it predictable
    
        var shortSalt = new byte[8];
        RandomNumberGenerator.Create().GetBytes(shortSalt);
        var fromShort = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, shortSalt);   // Noncompliant, salt is too short (should be at least 32 bytes, not 8)
    }


## Compliant Solution


    public DeriveBytes Hash(string password)
    {
        return new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, 64);
    }
