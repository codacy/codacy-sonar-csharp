## Why is this an issue?

Certain [mathematical comparisons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/comparison-operators)
will always return the same value, and should not be performed.

Specifically, the following comparisons will return either always `true` or always `false` depending on the kind of
comparison:

-   comparing a `char` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `char`
-   comparing a `float` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `float`
-   comparing a `long` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `long`
-   comparing a `ulong` with a numeric constant that is outside of the range of `ulong`
-   etc.

### Noncompliant code example

    float f = 42.0f;
    if (f <= double.MaxValue) { } // Noncompliant: always true
    if (f > double.MaxValue) { }  // Noncompliant: always false
