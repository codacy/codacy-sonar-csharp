When division is performed on `int`s, the result will always be an `int`. You can assign that result to a `double`, `float` or `decimal` with automatic type conversion, but having started as an `int`, the result will likely not be what you expect. If the result of `int` division is assigned to a floating-point variable, precision will have been lost before the assignment. Instead, at least one operand should be cast or promoted to the final type before the operation takes place.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    static void Main()
    {
      decimal dec = 3/2; // Noncompliant
      Method(3/2); // Noncompliant
    }
    
    static void Method(float f) { }

## Compliant Solution

    static void Main()
    {
      decimal dec = (decimal)3/2;
      Method(3.0F/2);
    }
    
    static void Method(float f) { }
