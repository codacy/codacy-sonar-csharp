When a cookie is protected with the `secure` attribute set to *true* it will not be send by the browser over an unencrypted HTTP
request and thus cannot be observed by an unauthorized person during a man-in-the-middle attack.

## Ask Yourself Whether

-   the cookie is for instance a *session-cookie* not designed to be sent over non-HTTPS communication.
-   it’s not sure that the website contains [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) or not
  (ie HTTPS everywhere or not)

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

-   It is recommended to use `HTTPs` everywhere so setting the `secure` flag to *true* should be the default behaviour
  when creating cookies.
-   Set the `secure` flag to *true* for session-cookies.

## Sensitive Code Example

When the `HttpCookie.Secure` property is set to `false` then the cookie will be send during an unencrypted HTTP request:

    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.Secure = false; //  Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag set to false

The [default value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie.secure?view=netframework-4.8) of
`Secure` flag is `false`, unless overwritten by an application’s configuration file:

    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    //  Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag not defined (by default set to false)

## Compliant Solution

Set the `HttpCookie.Secure` property to `true`:

    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.Secure = true; // Compliant

Or change the default flag values for the whole application by editing the [Web.config configuration file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms228262%28v=vs.100%29):

    <httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true" requireSSL="true" />

-   the `requireSSL` attribute corresponds programmatically to the `Secure` field.
-   the `httpOnlyCookies` attribute corresponds programmatically to the `httpOnly` field.
