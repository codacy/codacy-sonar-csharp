When a cookie is protected with the `secure` attribute set to *true* it will not be send by the browser over an unencrypted HTTP request and thus cannot be observed by an unauthorized person during a man-in-the-middle attack.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- the cookie is for instance a *session-cookie* not designed to be sent over non-HTTPS communication.
- it's not sure that the website contains [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) or not (ie
  HTTPS everywhere or not)


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- It is recommended to use `HTTPs` everywhere so setting the `secure` flag to *true* should be the default behaviour
  when creating cookies.
- Set the `secure` flag to *true* for session-cookies.


## Sensitive Code Example

In C# you can specify the secure flag with the HttpCookie.secure property:


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.Secure = false; //  Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag set to false


The [default value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie.secure?view=netframework-4.8) of `secure` flag is false:


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    //  Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag not defined (by default set to false)


## Compliant Solution


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.Secure = true; // Compliant: the security-sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag (Secure property) set to true
