In frequently used code paths, such as controller actions, you should avoid using the [HttpClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) directly and opt for [one of the IHttpClientFactory-based mechanisms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory) instead. This
way, you avoid wasting resources and creating performance overhead.

## Why is this an issue?

If a code path that creates and disposes of HttpClient objects is frequently used, then the following issues can occur:

-  Under heavy load, there’s the risk of [running out of available
  sockets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient-guidelines#pooled-connections), leading to [SocketException](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socketexception) errors. This
  is because each HttpClient instance uses a separate network connection, and there’s a limit to the number of connections that can be opened
  simultaneously. Note that even after you dispose of an HttpClient [its sockets are not immediately freed up](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests#issues-with-the-original-httpclient-class-available-in-net).
-  Each HttpClient has its own set of resources (like headers, base address, timeout, etc.) that must be managed. Creating a new HttpClient for
  every request means these resources are not being reused, leading to resource waste.
-  You introduce a significant performance overhead when creating a new HttpClient for every HTTP request.

## How to fix it

The [`IHttpClientFactory`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory) was introduced in
ASP.NET Core 2.1 to solve these problems. It handles pooling HTTP connections to optimize performance and reliability.

There are [several ways](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests#consumption-patterns) that you can use
IHttpClientFactory in your application:

-  [Basic usage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#basic-usage)
-  [Named Clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#named-clients)
-  [Typed Clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#typed-clients)
-  [Generated Clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory#generated-clients)

Alternatively, you may cache the HttpClient in a singleton or a static field. You should be aware that by default, the HttpClient doesn’t respect
the DNS’s Time To Live (TTL) settings. If the IP address associated with a domain name changes, HttpClient might still use the old, cached IP address,
leading to failed requests.

### Code examples

#### Noncompliant code example

    [ApiController]
    [Route("controller")]
    public class FooController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<string> Foo()
        {
            using var client = new HttpClient();  // Noncompliant
            return await client.GetStringAsync(_url);
        }
    }

#### Compliant solution

    // File: Startup.cs
    public class Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddHttpClient();
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    [ApiController]
    [Route("controller")]
    public class FooController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    
        public FooController(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
        {
            _clientFactory = clientFactory;
        }
    
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<string> Foo()
        {
            using var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient(); // Compliant (Basic usage)
            return await client.GetStringAsync(_url);
        }
    }
