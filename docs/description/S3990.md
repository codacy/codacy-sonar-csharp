Assemblies should conform with the Common Language Specification (CLS) in order to be usable across programming languages. To be compliant an assembly has to indicate it with `System.CLSCompliantAttribute`.
 
## Compliant Solution

    using System;
    
    [assembly:CLSCompliant(true)]
    namespace MyLibrary
    {
    }
