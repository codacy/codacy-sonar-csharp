Conditional expressions which are always `true` or `false` can lead to dead code. Such code is always buggy and should never<br>be used in production.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    a = false;
    if (a) // Noncompliant
    {
      DoSomething(); // never executed
    }
    
    if (!a || b) // Noncompliant; "!a" is always "true", "b" is never evaluated
    {
      DoSomething();
    }
    else
    {
      DoSomethingElse(); // never executed
    }


## Exceptions

This rule will not raise an issue in either of these cases:

- When the condition is a single `const bool`



    const bool debug = false;
    //...
    if (debug)
    {
      // Print something
    }


- When the condition is the literal `true` or `false`.


In these cases it is obvious the code is as intended.
