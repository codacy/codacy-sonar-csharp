## Why is this an issue?
 
When the same code is duplicated in two or more separate branches of a conditional, it can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and can potentially introduce bugs if one instance of the code is changed but others are not.
 
Having two `cases` in a `switch` statement or two branches in an `if` chain with the same implementation is at best duplicate code, and at worst a coding error.

    if (a >= 0 && a < 10)
    {
      DoFirst();
      DoTheThing();
    }
    else if (a >= 10 && a < 20)
    {
      DoTheOtherThing();
    }
    else if (a >= 20 && a < 50) // Noncompliant; duplicates first condition
    {
      DoFirst();
      DoTheThing();
    }

    switch (i)
    {
      case 1:
        DoFirst();
        DoSomething();
        break;
      case 2:
        DoSomethingDifferent();
        break;
      case 3:  // Noncompliant; duplicates case 1's implementation
        DoFirst();
        DoSomething();
        break;
      default:
        DoTheRest();
    }

If the same logic is truly needed for both instances, then:
 
- in an `if` chain they should be combined

    if ((a >= 0 && a < 10) || (a >= 20 && a < 50))
    {
      DoFirst();
      DoTheThing();
    }
    else if (a >= 10 && a < 20)
    {
      DoTheOtherThing();
    }

- for a `switch`, one should fall through to the other

    switch (i)
    {
      case 1:
      case 3:
        DoFirst();
        DoSomething();
        break;
      case 2:
        DoSomethingDifferent();
        break;
      default:
        DoTheRest();
    }

### Exceptions
 
Blocks in an `if` chain that contain a single line of code are ignored, as are blocks in a `switch` statement that contain a single line of code with or without a following `break`.

    if (a >= 0 && a < 10)
    {
      DoTheThing();
    }
    else if (a >= 10 && a < 20)
    {
      DoTheOtherThing();
    }
    else if (a >= 20 && a < 50)    //no issue, usually this is done on purpose to increase the readability
    {
      DoTheThing();
    }

But this exception does not apply to `if` chains without `else`-s, or to `switch`-es without default clauses when all branches have the same single line of code. In the case of `if` chains with `else`-s, or of `switch`-es with default clauses, rule {rule:csharpsquid:S3923} raises a bug.

    if(a == 1)
    {
      doSomething();  //Noncompliant, this might have been done on purpose but probably not
    }
    else if (a == 2)
    {
      doSomething();
    }
