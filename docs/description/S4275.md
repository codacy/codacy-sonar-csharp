## Why is this an issue?

Properties provide a way to enforce [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29) by providing
accessors that give controlled access to `private` fields. However, in classes with multiple fields, it is not unusual that [copy-and-paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-and-paste_programming) is used to quickly create the needed properties, which can result
in the wrong field being accessed by a getter or setter.

    class C
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;
        public int Y => x; // Noncompliant: The returned field should be 'y'
    }

This rule raises an issue in any of these cases:

-   A getter does not access the field with the corresponding name.
-   A setter does not update the field with the corresponding name.

For simple properties, it is better to use [auto-implemented
properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties) (C# 3.0 or later).

Field and property names are compared as case-insensitive. All underscore characters are ignored.

## How to fix it

### Code examples

#### Noncompliant code example

    class A
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;
    
        public int X
        {
            get { return x; }
            set { x = value; }
        }
    
        public int Y
        {
            get { return x; }  // Noncompliant: field 'y' is not used in the return value
            set { x = value; } // Noncompliant: field 'y' is not updated
        }
    }

#### Compliant solution

    class A
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;
    
        public int X
        {
            get { return x; }
            set { x = value; }
        }
    
        public int Y
        {
            get { return y; }
            set { y = value; }
        }
    }
