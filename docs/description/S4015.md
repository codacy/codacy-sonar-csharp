## Why is this an issue?

Decreasing the [accessibility
level](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers) of an inherited method that is not [overridable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override) to [private](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/private) will shadow the name of the base method and can
lead to confusion.

    public class Base
    {
        public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
    }
    public class Derived : Base
    {
        private void SomeMethod(int count) { } // Noncompliant
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        public void DoWork()
        {
            var derived = new Derived();
            derived.SomeMethod(42); // Base.SomeMethod is accessed here
        }
    }

Another potential problem is the case of a class deriving from `Derived` and accessing `SomeMethod`. In this scenario, the
method accessed will instead be the `Base` implementation, which might not be what was expected.

    public class Base
    {
        public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
    }
    public class Derived : Base
    {
        private void SomeMethod(int count) { } // Noncompliant
    }
    
    public class SecondDerived : Derived
    {
        public void DoWork()
        {
            SomeMethod(42); // Base.SomeMethod is accessed here
        }
    }

One way to mitigate this, is by sealing the `Derived` class by using the [sealed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed) modifier, thus preventing inheritance from this
point on.

    public class Base
    {
        public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
    }
    public sealed class Derived : Base
    {
        private void SomeMethod(int count) { } // Compliant: class is marked as sealed
    }

Another way to mitigate this, is by having the `Derived` implementation match the [accessibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers) modifier of the
`Base` implementation of `SomeMethod`. From a callerâ€™s perspective, this is closer to the expected behavior.

    using System;
    
    namespace MyLibrary
    {
        public class Base
        {
            public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
        }
        public class Derived : Base
        {
            public void SomeMethod(int count) { } // Compliant: same accessibility as Base.SomeMethod
        }
    
        public class Program
        {
            public void DoWork()
            {
                var derived = new Derived();
                derived.SomeMethod(42); // Derived.SomeMethod is called
            }
        }
    }

Last but not least, consider using a different name for the `Derived` method, thus completely eliminating any confusion caused by the
naming collision.

    public class Base
    {
        public void SomeMethod(int count) { }
    }
    public class Derived : Base
    {
        private void SomeOtherMethod(int count) { } // Compliant
    }
