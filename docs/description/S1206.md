There is a contract between `Equals(object)` and `GetHashCode()`: If two objects are equal according to the `Equals(object)` method, then calling `GetHashCode()` on each of them must yield the same result. If this is not the case, many collections won't handle class instances correctly.

In order to comply with the contract, `Equals(object)` and `GetHashCode()` should be either both inherited, or both overridden.

## Noncompliant Code Example


    class MyClass {    // Noncompliant - should also override "hashCode()"
    
      @Override
      public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        /* ... */
      }
    
    }


## Compliant Solution


    class MyClass {    // Compliant
    
      @Override
      public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        /* ... */
      }
    
      @Override
      public int hashCode() {
        /* ... */
      }
    
    }
