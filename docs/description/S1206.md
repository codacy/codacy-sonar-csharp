There is a contract between `Equals(object)` and `GetHashCode()`: If two objects are equal according to the `Equals(object)` method, then calling `GetHashCode()` on each of them must yield the same result. If this is not the case, many collections wonâ€™t handle class instances correctly.
 
In order to comply with the contract, `Equals(object)` and `GetHashCode()` should be either both inherited, or both overridden.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    class MyClass   // Noncompliant - should also override "GetHashCode()"
    {
        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

## Compliant Solution

    class MyClass
    {
        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            // ...
        }
    
        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
