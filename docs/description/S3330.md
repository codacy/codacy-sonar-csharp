When a cookie is configured with the `HttpOnly` attribute set to *true*, the browser guaranties that no client-side script will be able to read it. In most cases, when a cookie is created, the default value of `HttpOnly` is *false* and it's up to the developer to decide whether or not the content of the cookie can be read by the client-side script. As a majority of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks target the theft of session-cookies, the `HttpOnly` attribute can help to reduce their impact as it won't be possible to exploit the XSS vulnerability to steal session-cookies.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- the cookie is sensitive, used to authenticate the user, for instance a *session-cookie*
- the `HttpOnly` attribute offer an additional protection (not the case for an *XSRF-TOKEN cookie* / CSRF token for example)<br>


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- By default the `HttpOnly` flag should be set to *true* for most of the cookies and it's mandatory for session /<br>  sensitive-security cookies.


## Sensitive Code Example

For example In C# you can specify the HttpOnly flag for [HttpCookie](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie?view=netframework-4.8) object.


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.HttpOnly = false;  // Sensitive:  this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability


The [default value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpcookie.httponly?view=netframework-4.8) of `secure` flag is false:


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag not defined (by default set to false)  and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability


## Compliant Solution


    HttpCookie myCookie = new HttpCookie("Sensitive cookie");
    myCookie.HttpOnly = true; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the HttpOnly property set to true (HttpOnly = true)
