## Why is this an issue?
 
It is needlessly complex to invert the result of a boolean comparison. The opposite comparison should be made instead.
 
### Noncompliant code example

    if ( !(a == 2)) { ...}  // Noncompliant
    bool b = !(i < 10);  // Noncompliant

### Compliant solution

    if (a != 2) { ...}
    bool b = (i >= 10);
