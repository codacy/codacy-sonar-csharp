`GC.SuppressFinalize` requests that the system not call the finalizer for the specified object. This should only be done when implementing `Dispose` as part of the [Dispose Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b1yfkh5e.aspx).

This rule raises an issue when `GC.SuppressFinalize` is called outside that pattern.
