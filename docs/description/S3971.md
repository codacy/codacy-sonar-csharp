## Why is this an issue?

`GC.SuppressFinalize` requests that the system not call the finalizer for the specified object. This should only be done when
implementing `Dispose` as part of the [Dispose Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose).

This rule raises an issue when `GC.SuppressFinalize` is called outside that pattern.
