The difference between `private` and `protected` visibility is that child classes can see and use `protected`
members, but they cannot see `private` ones. Since a `sealed` class cannot have children, marking its members
`protected` is confusingly pointless.

## Noncompliant Code Example

<pre>
public sealed class MySealedClass
{
    protected string name = "Fred";  // Noncompliant
    protected void SetName(string name) // Noncompliant
    {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>

## Compliant Solution

<pre>
public sealed class MySealedClass
{
    private string name = "Fred";
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>
