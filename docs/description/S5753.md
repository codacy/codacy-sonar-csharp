ASP.NET 1.1+ comes with a feature called *Request Validation*, preventing the server to accept content containing un-encoded HTML. This feature comes as a first protection layer against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and act as a simple Web Application Firewall (WAF) rejecting requests potentially containing malicious content.

While this feature is not a silver bullet to prevent all XSS attacks, it helps to catch basic ones. It will for example prevent `<script
type="text/javascript" src="https://malicious.domain/payload.js">` to reach your Controller.

Note: *Request Validation* feature being only available for ASP.NET, no Security Hotspot is raised on ASP.NET Core applications.

## Ask Yourself Whether

- the developer doesn't know the impact to deactivate the Request Validation feature
- the web application accepts user supplied data
- all user supplied data are not validated


There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.

## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

- Activate the Request Validation feature for all HTTP requests


## Sensitive Code Example

At Controller level:


    [ValidateInput(false)]
    public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
    {
      ...
    }


At application level, configured in the Web.config file:


    <configuration>
       <system.web>
          <pages validateRequest="false" />
          ...
          <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="0.0" />
       </system.web>
    </configuration>


## Compliant Solution

At Controller level:


    [ValidateInput(true)]
    public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
    {
      ...
    }


or


    public ActionResult Welcome(string name)
    {
      ...
    }


At application level, configured in the Web.config file:


    <configuration>
       <system.web>
          <pages validateRequest="true" />
          ...
          <httpRuntime requestValidationMode="4.5" />
       </system.web>
    </configuration>
