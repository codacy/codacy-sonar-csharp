Throwing an exception from within a finally block will mask any exception which was previously thrown in the `try` or `catch` block, and the masked’s exception message and stack trace will be lost.
 
## Noncompliant Code Example

    try
    {
      /* some work which end up throwing an exception */
      throw new ArgumentException();
    }
    finally
    {
      /* clean up */
      throw new InvalidOperationException();       // Noncompliant; will mask the ArgumentException
    }

## Compliant Solution

    try
    {
      /* some work which end up throwing an exception */
      throw new ArgumentException();
    }
    finally
    {
      /* clean up */                       // Compliant
    }
