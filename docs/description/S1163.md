## Why is this an issue?

If an exception is already being thrown within the `try` block or caught in a `catch` block, throwing another exception in
the `finally` block will override the original exception. This means that the original exceptionâ€™s message and stack trace will be lost,
potentially making it challenging to diagnose and troubleshoot the root cause of the problem.

    try
    {
      // Some work which end up throwing an exception
      throw new ArgumentException();
    }
    finally
    {
      // Cleanup
      throw new InvalidOperationException(); // Noncompliant: will mask the ArgumentException
    }

    try
    {
      // Some work which end up throwing an exception
      throw new ArgumentException();
    }
    finally
    {
      // Cleanup without throwing
    }
