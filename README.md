# Codacy SonarC#

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to run [SonarC#](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-csharp) developed by SonarSource.

You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Local Development

**Requirements**:
  - unzip 
  - xmllint
    * on ubuntu: `apt-get install libxml2-utils`
    * on alpine: `apk add libxml2-utils`
  - dotnet-sdk - "The .NET Core SDK"
    * on archlinux: the above package also installs `dotnet-runtime`, `dotnet-host` and `dotnet-targeting-pack`) - the .NET Core SDK

### IDE

This seems to be more or less working in vscode, install the 
"C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)" extension 
and before opening the project in it do `make configure`.

### Commands

  - `make configure` - runs `dotnet restore` which downloads all the required libraries for the projects to work.
  - `make build` - compiles the *Analyzer* project.
  - `make build-docs` - compiles the *DocsGenerator* project.
  - `make build-all` - compiles both the *Analyzer* and *DocsGenerator* projects.
  - `make documentation` - downloads upstream rules for the *sonar version* we defined in `Analyzer.csproj`,
    extracts the rules for that version and runs the *DocsGenerator* application.

See other useful targets inside the `Makefile`.

## Usage

### Publish the docker image locally

```bash
docker build -t codacy-sonar-csharp:local .
```

### Run the docker locally

```bash
docker run --user=docker --rm -v <PATH-TO-CODE>:/src:ro -v <PATH-TO>/.codacyrc:/.codacyrc:ro codacy-sonar-csharp:local
```

### Enter inside the docker image

```bash
docker run --user=docker --rm -v <PATH-TO-CODE>:/src:ro -v <PATH-TO>/.codacyrc:/.codacyrc:ro -it --entrypoint /bin/sh codacy-sonar-csharp:local
```

> Make sure all the volumes mounted have the right permissions for user `docker`

## Tool configuration file

Currently, to use your own configuration file, you must add a SonarLint.xml xml file with an AnalysisInput structure inside.

Example:
```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <AnalysisInput>
      <Rules>
        <Rule>
          <Key>S103</Key>
          <Parameters>
            <Parameter>
              <Key>maximumLineLength</Key>  
              <Value>24</Value>  
            </Parameter>
          </Parameters>
        </Rule>
      </Rules>
    </AnalysisInput>
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
