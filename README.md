# Codacy SonarC#

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to run [SonarC#](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-csharp) developed by SonarSource.

You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Local Development

**Requirements**:
 - unzip, xmllint
 - mono - implementation of .NET platform including compiler and runtime
 - dotnet-sdk (on Archlinux also installs dotnet-runtim & dotnet-host & dotnet-targeting-pack) - the .NET Core SDK

Compile the code with `make build-all`, just the main code with `make build`, or just the docs generator with `make build-docs`.
See other useful targets inside the `Makefile`.


## Usage

### Publish the docker

```bash
make publish
docker build -t codacy-sonar-csharp .
```

### Run the docker

```bash
docker run --user=docker --rm=true -v <PATH-TO-CODE>:/src -v <PATH-TO>/.codacyrc:/.codacyrc codacy-sonar-csharp
```

> Make sure all the volumes mounted have the right permissions for user `docker`

### Generate Docs

**Requirements:**

-   `xmllint` utility installed on your system:

    -   On ubuntu:

            apt-get install libxml2-utils

    -   On alpine

            apk add libxml2-utils

**Generate:**

```sh
make documentation
```

## Tool configuration file

Currently, to use your own configuration file, you must add a SonarLint.xml xml file with an AnalysisInput structure inside.

Example:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <AnalysisInput>
      <Rules>
        <Rule>
          <Key>S103</Key>
          <Parameters>
            <Parameter>
              <Key>maximumLineLength</Key>  
              <Value>24</Value>  
            </Parameter>
          </Parameters>
        </Rule>
      </Rules>
    </AnalysisInput>

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
